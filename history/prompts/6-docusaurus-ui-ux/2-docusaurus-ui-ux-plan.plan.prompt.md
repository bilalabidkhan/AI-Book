## Prompt Text

```
Audit routing, sidebar, and theme configuration to fix broken pages and duplicate chapters, then refactor Docusaurus layout, typography, and navigation using custom CSS for a clean, professional reading experience.
```

## Response Text

Completed comprehensive implementation plan for the Professional UI/UX upgrade for Docusaurus site "My AI Book". The plan includes:

- Technical context identifying Docusaurus framework, JavaScript/TypeScript, and custom CSS as primary technologies
- Constitution check confirming all principles are satisfied
- Project structure outlining documentation and source code organization
- Research findings identifying key issues to address (routing, sidebar duplication, typography, dark mode)
- Data model defining entities for documentation pages, sidebar navigation, theme configuration, and typography settings
- Quickstart guide with setup instructions and implementation steps
- UI component contracts defining interface and behavior for theme, navigation, and responsive components

The plan is structured to systematically address the audit of routing, sidebar, and theme configuration, followed by refactoring of layout, typography, and navigation using custom CSS for the professional academic reading experience.
