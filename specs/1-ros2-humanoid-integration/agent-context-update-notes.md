# Agent Context Update Notes

## Planned Action
The following command would have been executed to update the agent context:
`.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`

## Purpose
This script would have updated the Claude Code agent context with the new technology stack information related to:
- Docusaurus framework
- ROS 2 technical concepts
- Markdown documentation structure
- Web-based book deployment

## Status
Since PowerShell is not available in this environment, this step was not executed. The technology information has been documented in the implementation plan and related files.
