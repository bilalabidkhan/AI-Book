# 🤖 Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **My AI Book**, a structured and hands-on textbook focused on **AI systems operating in the physical world**.  
This book bridges the gap between **AI software (the brain)** and **humanoid robots (the body)** using modern robotics and simulation tools.

---

## 📘 About This Book

You will learn how to:
- Control humanoid robots using **ROS 2**
- Simulate robots and environments using **Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac**
- Build **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** systems powered by LLMs
- Design AI agents that perceive, plan, and act in the real world

The content is organized as **modules**, each building toward an autonomous humanoid capstone project.
