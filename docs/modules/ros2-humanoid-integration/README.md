# ROS 2 Humanoid Integration

Welcome to the ROS 2 Humanoid Integration module. This module focuses on using ROS 2 as the "Robotic Nervous System" to connect AI agents to humanoid robot bodies.

## Chapters

This module contains three main chapters that will guide you through the essential concepts:

1. **[ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros2-fundamentals.md)** - Understanding the core concepts of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. **[Python Agent Integration](./python-agents-ros2.md)** - Connecting AI agents to robot controllers using rclpy
3. **[Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./humanoid-modeling-urdf.md)** - Creating robot models with Unified Robot Description Format

## Learning Path

We recommend following these chapters in order as each builds on the concepts introduced in the previous ones.
