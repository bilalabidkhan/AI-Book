# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of our comprehensive guide to AI and Robotics. This module focuses on creating digital twins for humanoid robots using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization.

## Overview

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that enable testing, validation, and development of robotic systems in a safe and cost-effective environment. In the context of humanoid robotics, digital twins allow engineers to:

- Test control algorithms without risk of damaging expensive hardware
- Validate sensor configurations and perception systems
- Optimize robot behaviors before deployment
- Train AI models in realistic simulated environments

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How to set up physics-based simulations with Gazebo for humanoid robots
- How to simulate various sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) for perception testing
- How to create high-fidelity environments with Unity for realistic visualization
- How to integrate Gazebo physics with Unity visualization for comprehensive digital twins

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI and robotics engineers building simulated humanoid environments. A basic understanding of robotics concepts is helpful but not required.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. [Physics-based Simulation with Gazebo](./gazebo-physics-simulation) - Learn about physics simulation fundamentals
2. [Sensors Simulation](./simulated-sensors) - Understand how to simulate various sensors for perception systems
3. [High-Fidelity Environments with Unity](./unity-high-fidelity) - Create visually rich environments for realistic testing

Each chapter builds upon the previous one while remaining independently valuable.
