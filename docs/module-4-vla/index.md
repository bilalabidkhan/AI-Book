# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigm represents a unified approach to robot control where vision, language, and action are tightly integrated. This module explores how language models can control humanoid robots through perception and action, enabling natural human-robot interaction.

## Overview

VLA systems combine three critical components:

1. **Vision Processing**: Understanding the environment through visual input
2. **Language Understanding**: Interpreting natural language commands
3. **Action Execution**: Converting high-level goals into robot actions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How to process voice commands using OpenAI Whisper
- Techniques for cognitive planning with LLMs
- Vision-guided manipulation strategies
- Integration of these components into a cohesive system

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2
- Familiarity with Python and robotics concepts
- Knowledge of machine learning fundamentals
